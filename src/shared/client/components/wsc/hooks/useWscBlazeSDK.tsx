  useWscBlazeSDK Hook (Next.js Client-Side Loading):

  This custom hook is tailored for Next.js applications, providing a seamless integration of the Blaze SDK (Blaze Web SDK) on the client side. 
  It accounts for server-side rendering (SSR) to ensure proper functionality in a Next.js environment.

  Hook Logic:
  - Initializes state for the Blaze SDK instance and loading status using the useState hook.
  - Utilizes the useEffect hook to asynchronously load the Blaze SDK only on the client side during component mounting.
  - The loaded SDK instance is stored in state upon successful loading.
  - Components can check the readiness of the Blaze SDK through the 'isBlazeSDKReady' boolean.

  Usage:
  - Import this hook into Next.js components to effortlessly manage Blaze SDK integration on the client side.
  - Designed to prevent server-side rendering issues by checking for the presence of 'window' before attempting to import the SDK.

  Example Usage:
  const { blazeSDK, isBlazeSDKReady } = useWscBlazeSDK();
  // Access 'blazeSDK' for Blaze SDK instance and 'isBlazeSDKReady' for loading status.

  Note: The loading status is particularly useful for scenarios where components need to wait for the Blaze SDK to be fully loaded before executing certain actions.
